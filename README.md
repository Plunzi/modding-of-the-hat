## Creating Skins

### **UABE** Installation

```
- King Of The Hat, as with many other Unity Games keeps its assets in a .assets file.
This means that you cannot directly access the .png files that it references for these assets. 
```

```
- Fortunately, through the power of third party software, we are able to extract those images.

- To do so, we currently use a tool known as Unity Assets Bundle Extractor, or UABE for short.
```
_(UABE is **OPEN SOURCE**, which means everyone is able to **view the code**, therefore it can be **considered safe** to download and use. We have added the origin GitHub and a republish via google drive uploaded by POOPATRON.)_

**NOTE:** UABE currently only supports Windows.
